# Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and 
# return a new string.

# For example:

# remove_chars("pynative", 4) so output must be tive. Here we need to remove first four characters from a string.
# remove_chars("pynative", 2) so output must be native. Here we need to remove first two characters from a string.

def Exercise_4(x,y):
    print(x[y:])

Exercise_4('pynative', 4)
Exercise_4('pynative', 2)
