# Given two integer numbers return 
# their product only if the product is 
# equal to or lower than 1000, else return their sum.

# def question_1(x, y):
#     if x * y <= 1000:
#         print("The result is", x * y)
#     else:
#         print("The result is", x + y)

# Exercise 2: Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.



# def question_2():
#     a = 0;
#     for i in range(10):
#         b = i+a;
#         c = b-i;
#         print('Current Number', i, "Previous Number", c, "Sum", b)

# Exercise 3: Write a program to accept a string from the user and display 
# characters that are present at an even index number.
# For example, str = "pynative" so you should display ‘p’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘v’.

# def question_3(x):
#     for i in range(len(x)):
#         if i % 2 == 0:
#             print(x[i])

# question_3("love")


# Exercise 4: Remove first n characters from a string
# Write a program to remove characters from a 
# string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.

# For example:

# remove_chars("pynative", 4) so output must be tive. Here we need to remove first four characters from a string.
# remove_chars("pynative", 2) so output must be native. Here we need to remove first two characters from a string.
# Note: n must be less than the length of the string.

# def question_4(x,y):
#     print(x[y:])

# question_4("pynative", 4)



# Exercise 5: Check if the first and last number of a list is the same
# Write a function to return True if the first and last number of a given 
# list is same. If numbers are different then return False.
# Given:
# numbers_x = [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
# numbers_y = [75, 65, 35, 75, 30]
# Expected Output:
# Given list: [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
# result is True
# numbers_y = [75, 65, 35, 75, 30]

# def question_5(x):
#     print(x[0] == x[-1])

# def question_6(x):
#     for i in x:
#         if i % 5 == 0:
#             print(i)

# question_6([10,12,14,16,20])
